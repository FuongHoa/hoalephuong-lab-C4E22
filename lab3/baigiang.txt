* Function: used in big math problems which is hard to solve w/ other ways

1. simple_add.py:
String formating: 
.format() 

2. f_math.py: (only sum)
- produce the math problem: x, y, z
"from random import randint": import an integer

- calculate the solution
Use 'if...'

3. f_math2.py:
* Reusability

* Single entity
=> Function

When see (): a function

4. calc.py:
- define function: def => built-in functions

- use function (call function): add() => user-defined function
=> built-in functions

- Scope: 
Where the variable is produced is also where it dies
def - function scope

Return: = return the result
	= break in "While"
